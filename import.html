Here's how it works:</p><p><strong>Step 1: External Activity Detection</strong><br>Create a hidden tag in Circle (e.g., \"PWA_Grammar_Check_Complete\") that won't be visible to members but serves as a trigger mechanism.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Integration Bridge</strong><br>Set up a Zapier automation (or use our APIs directly) that connects your PWA to Circle. When a user completes a desired activity on ProWritingAid, the integration automatically tags that member with the corresponding hidden tag.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Reward Automation</strong><br>Create a Circle workflow that monitors for the hidden tag. When the tag is applied to a member, the workflow automatically awards the specified points/rewards and then removes the tag to reset the trigger.</p><p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations:</strong></p><ul><li>This approach isn't 100% bulletproof for rapid, repeated activities</li><li>The complete cycle of adding tags, processing rewards, and removing tags can take several seconds to a minute to complete</li><li>Users performing the same activity multiple times in quick succession might not receive all intended rewards</li><li>If users perform multiple rewarded activities within a short timeframe, some rewards may not process due to timing delays</li></ul><p>This connects your external website to our rewards, but since it takes time to process, it works best for important milestones rather than quick, frequent activities.</p>",
